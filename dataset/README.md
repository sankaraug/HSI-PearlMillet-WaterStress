# Pearl Millet Water Stress Detection Dataset

The **Pearl Millet Water Stress Detection dataset** is a curated collection of hyperspectral images captured using a UAV platform to monitor and analyze water stress in pearl millet canopies. This dataset was collected during **field experiments conducted at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, India**, during the **2021â€“2022 agricultural season**. It provides detailed spectral information to study stress-induced variations in crop reflectance and supports research on waveband selection for stress detection.

The hyperspectral images span a **spectral range of 400â€“1000 nm** with **282 narrow spectral bands**, recorded using a **Resonon Pika-L hyperspectral camera** mounted on a **DJI Matrice-600 Pro UAV**. Images were acquired at a **spatial resolution of approximately 1â€“2 cm per pixel**. Radiometric calibration panels and GPS/INS data were used to ensure accurate reflectance values and georeferencing.



## Dataset Contains

The dataset consists of **hyperspectral cubes of pearl millet canopies** under both **well-watered** and **water-stressed conditions**, captured at different growth stages during the season.  


## **Dataset Highlights**
- Designed for **water stress detection** and **band selection studies** in pearl millet.  
- Enables spectral analysis of stress indicators using narrow-band hyperspectral data.  
- Provides high-resolution UAV imagery suitable for research in **precision agriculture** and **hyperspectral feature extraction**.
